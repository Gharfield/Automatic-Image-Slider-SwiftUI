# Automatic-Image-Slider-SwiftUI
Im trying to create an automatic image slider, but I've encountered a few problems which I can't seem to figure out. Would be much appreciated if someone would take a look at this, and help me out.

Problem i have now:

When the slider is interacted with, the timer stops after the user is done with the slider.

What im trying to achieve is:

Infinite Scrolling View
Page indicators to be shown at the far down left of the image slider.
Page indicators to be shown with (-) instead of (.)
Attached text and description to each slide (Title and smaller text) should be located above the page indicators.
When user interacts and click the the specific image in slider, the user will be directed to a specific page which is linked to that picture.

If anyone could take a look at this, it would be much appreciated.
Any help or feedback is also very, very much HELPFUL. 
Thanks!
